## Introduction

This repository serves as a collection of fundamental data structures and algorithms that are commonly used in computer science. The implementations are written in cpp programming language, providing you with a variety of examples and solutions.

Feel free to explore the code and use it as a reference. If you have any suggestions or improvements, contributions are always welcome!

## Data Structures

The following data structures are currently implemented:

- Array
- Linked List
- Stack
- Queue
- Binary Tree
